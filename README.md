# PathTracer
A dynamic graph path visualizer implemented in Python, offering interactive exploration and visualization of graph traversal and shortest path finding using Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Dijkstra's algorithms.

## Features:

### `Interactive Visualization`
Explore graph traversal and shortest path finding in real-time with an intuitive and interactive user interface.

### `DFS Algorithm`:
Visualize the Depth-First Search algorithm's execution, which explores the graph by traversing as deep as possible along each branch before backtracking.

### `BFS Algorithm`: 
Observe the Breadth-First Search algorithm's operation, exploring the graph layer by layer, ensuring the shortest path is found.

### `Dijkstra's Algorithm`:
Experience the Dijkstra's algorithm visualization, which computes the shortest paths from a source node to all other nodes in the graph.
